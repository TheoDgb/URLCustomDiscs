## About
This plugin, along with a required server resource pack, allows you to create and play custom music discs from YouTube URLs on your Minecraft server, with real-time updates for players.

Once installed, everything is done in-game, and there's no need to manually edit the server resource pack files to add or remove discs.

The plugin supports Minecraft's spatial audio for music, but you can also play it in stereo.

Additionally, Vanilla commands such as `/playsound` and `/stopsound` work with the custom music, so you do not need to use a disc in a jukebox.

Important:
- Currently works on Windows and Linux due to dependencies.
- Make sure to use a direct video link without parameters (such as playlist, timecode, etc.), or you might be in for a surprise. Delete everything starting from & in the URL.

Note: plugin tested on 1.21.0-1 Spigot, Paper and Arclight servers <br>
--Partially works in 1.21.4: discs can be created, deleted, and played using vanilla commands, but don't play as intended in a jukebox.

## Dependencies
- **yt-dlp** to download an MP3 audio file from a YouTube URL.
- **FFmpeg** to convert MP3 format to Ogg format.
- A **personal local HTTP server** hosting the server resource pack, which allows:
  - the plugin to edit the server resource pack via an absolute path for locally-hosted Minecraft server;
  - the plugin to edit the server resource pack via download and upload (POST method) for online-hosted Minecraft server;
  - players to download the server resource pack and receive real-time updates for custom music discs.

### License And Attribution
This plugin uses **yt-dlp** ([unlicense](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/LICENSE)) and **FFmpeg** from the [FFmpeg.org](http://ffmpeg.org/) under the [LGPLv2.1](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html).<br>
yt-dlp and FFmpeg are not included in this project and must be installed separately.

## Download
The **URLCustomDiscs.jar** plugin and the **URLCustomDiscsPack.zip** server resource pack are available for download in the [**Releases**](https://github.com/TheoDgb/URLCustomDiscs/releases) section. <br>
It is also available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/url-custom-discs) ([**Versions**](https://modrinth.com/plugin/url-custom-discs/versions)).

## Servers Guide
Important:
- For users who don't want or can't host their Minecraft server on their own personal machine, it's common to turn to online hosting providers.
  Keep in mind that youâ€™ll still need a personal HTTP server to host the resource pack for the custom music discs to be added and updated automatically.
- If you're using shared hosting like Shockbyte or a similar provider, **make sure your host allows you to run binary files** (for yt-dlp and FFmpeg, in our case).
  Some hosts may have restrictions or require special permissions. Check their documentation or contact their support if you're not sure.
- For full control and compatibility, it's highly recommended to use a VPS (Virtual Private Server), which gives you full root access, instead of shared Minecraft hosting.
  With a VPS, you can host both your Minecraft server and an (Apache) HTTP server on the same machine, making it ideal for serving the resource pack directly.
  The Apache server setup on a VPS is not covered in this guide (locally only). Configuring the IP, ports, firewall, and other related settings is the user's responsibility, as these can vary depending on the VPS provider. However, the steps to set up an Apache server remain the same on a VPS.
  Just make sure to configure your firewall and open the necessary ports, as VPS environments usually require manual network setup.

The following shared Minecraft hosting providers have been tested or confirmed to allow the execution of binary files (yt-dlp / FFmpeg):
- Compatible:
  - ElypseCloud allows you to upload custom binaries via FileZilla or SSH directly to your Minecraft server's plugin folder, and also lets you grant execution permissions through its built-in file manager (tested in 2025).
- Not compatible:
  - Shockbyte shared hosting environments block the execution of external or custom binaries (tested in 2025).

Note: If you've confirmed compatibility or incompatibility with another shared Minecraft hosting provider, feel free to let me know on the [UrlCustomDiscs Discord](https://discord.gg/tdWztKWzcm) so I can update the list!

**THAT BEING SAID,**

You'll need to host the **URLCustomDiscsPack.zip** server resource pack on a **personal local HTTP server** that the plugin can access and edit. Using an online file hosting service (such as [MCPacks](https://mc-packs.net/)) will not work.

Here are two tutorials for setting up a **personal local HTTP server** (Windows / Linux). These tutorials cover how to make your **personal local HTTP server** work with both local and online Minecraft servers.

### Router Configuration
- Access your router's interface to:
  - configure a NAT/PAT rule for TCP port forwarding, setting both internal and external ports to 80, and using the **private IP address** of the machine running the **Apache HTTP server**;
  - open TCP port 80, which is the default for HTTP traffic, in your firewall to allow incoming connections to the machine running the Apache server.

- Access your router's interface
  <img src="/media/router_example_1_router_interface.png" alt="router_example_1_router_interface">
- In your router's network settings, configure a NAT/PAT rule to forward TCP port 80 (both internal and external) to the **private IPv4 address** of the machine running the **Apache HTTP server**.
  - On some routers, you may not be able to directly select a device by its name from a list. In that case, you'll need to manually enter the **private IPv4 address** of the machine running the **Apache HTTP server**. Make sure that this address is either statically assigned or reserved via DHCP on the router, so it doesn't change over time.
  - To find the **private IPv4 (or IPv6) address** of your machine:
    - on Windows, open the command prompt and type: ```ipconfig```
    - on Linux, open a terminal and type: ```ip a```

  <img src="/media/router_example_4_port_forwarding.png" alt="router_example_4_port_forwarding">
- In your router's firewall, open TCP port 80, which is the default for HTTP traffic, to allow incoming connections to the **private IPv4 (or IPv6) address** of the machine running the **Apache HTTP server**.

</details>

Router NAT Loopback Limitation (Local Access Issue): <br>
- If you are using a setup where the **Apache HTTP server** and the Minecraft game are running on **two different machines on the same local network**, and everything is correctly installed and configured but **you** (the server owner) don't receive the server resource pack while other players do, your router may not support **NAT loopback**. This means that if a machine on the local network tries to access the **public IP address** of the router to reach another local machine, the connection may fail. This issue **only affects connections from inside your local network**. <br>
- To work around this, you can manually download the server resource pack via the **private IPv4 address**: [http://your_private_ipv4/URLCustomDiscsPack.zip](). Then place it in your .minecraft/resourcepacks/ folder to use it as a classic resource pack. However, you'll need to **reinstall it manually** each time a disc is created or deleted in order to stay up to date.

### Personal Local HTTP Server
For the following steps, you'll need the **public IPv4 address** of your network (assigned by your ISP). You can quickly find it on websites like [WhatIsMyIp.com](https://www.whatismyip.com/). This is the address external users will use to reach the machine running the **Apache HTTP server**.

<summary><b>Extra steps for an online-hosted Minecraft server (Apache server on Windows)</b></summary>

- Download PHP ([Thread Safe version zip](https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.4.5-Win32-vs17-x64.zip)) from [php.net](https://windows.php.net/download/).
- Extract all the files from the zip archive to C:/php/
- In C:/php/, duplicate php.ini-development and rename the copy to "php.ini".
  - This is the configuration files for PHP, where you can set file size limits, execution times, and more.
- In php.ini, change the values of the following lines to your desired limits:
  - For reference: If you plan to upload 50 music files of approximately 3 minutes (around 150MB), you should set the values between 200MB-300MB to be on the safe side. Keep in mind that the more music files you add, the longer the upload process will take.
    - upload_max_filesize: This defines the maximum size of files that can be uploaded. <br>
      `upload_max_filesize = 300M`
    - post_max_size: This value defines the maximum size for a POST request (it must be at least equal to upload_max_filesize). <br>
      `post_max_size = 300M`
    - max_execution_time: This determines how long a PHP script can run before it is terminated. We increase it to 300 seconds (5 minutes) to allow more time for large uploads. <br>
      `max_execution_time = 300`
    - max_input_time: This defines the maximum time a script can spend receiving data. We set this to 300 seconds to accommodate large file uploads. <br>
      `max_input_time = 300`
- Open C:/Apache24/conf/httpd.conf
  - Locate the "LoadModule" lines and add the following line to load PHP: <br>
    `LoadModule php_module "C:/php/php8apache2_4.dll"`
    - Verify that the version "php8apache2_4.dll" corresponds to the one you downloaded and extracted.
  - Below this line, add the following line to specify the location of the php.ini file: <br>
    `PHPIniDir "C:/php"`
  - Locate the "AddType" lines and add the following line to associate PHP files: <br>
    `AddType application/x-httpd-php .php`
- In C:/Apache24/htdocs/, create an info.php file with the following content: <br>
  `<?php phpinfo(); ?>`
- Restart Apache, then try to access [http://your_public_ip:80/info.php]().
  - If PHP is correctly installed and configured, you should see a page with PHP configuration details, meaning PHP is working with Apache.
- In C:/Apache24/htdocs/, create an upload.php file with the following content:
```
<?php
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST' && isset($_FILES['file'])) {
    $target_dir = "C:/Apache24/htdocs/";
    $target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES["file"]["name"]);

    file_put_contents("C:/Apache24/htdocs/upload_log.txt", print_r($_FILES, true));

    if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"], $target_file)) {
        echo "Success";
    } else {
        echo "Error uploading file";
    }
} else {
    echo "No file uploaded";
    file_put_contents("C:/Apache24/htdocs/upload_log.txt", print_r($_FILES, true));
}
?>
```
- Restart Apache to ensure the changes take effect.

  ```
  - You can disable Apache at startup: `sudo systemctl disable apache2`
- Set the correct permissions for the /var/www/html directory: <br>
  `sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html`
  - This allows the owner to read, write, and execute, while others can only read and execute.
- Set the correct ownership to make changes in /var/www/html/: <br>
  `sudo chown -R <your_user>:<your_user> /var/www/html`
- Download the URLCustomDiscsPack.zip server resource pack and place it in the /var/www/html/ directory.
- Reset the ownership for www-data to ensure the HTTP server can access the files:

## Configuration Guide
- Download the **URLCustomDiscs.jar** plugin and place it in your Minecraft server's plugins folder.
- Download the **URLCustomDiscsPack.zip** server resource pack and place it in the directory of your **personal local HTTP server**, as specified in the Servers Guide, to make it available for download and editing.
- Start your Minecraft server to allow the plugin to generate the necessary files.
- In your Minecraft server folder, open plugins/URLCustomDiscs/config.yml and follow the instructions to properly configure the file.
- In your Minecraft server's server.properties file, locate the line "resource-pack=" and update it to include your download URL:
  `resource-pack=http://your_public_ip:80/URLCustomDiscsPack.zip`
  - You can also force the server resource pack to be downloaded for players by setting: <br>
    `require-resource-pack=true`
- Restart your Minecraft server
